Introduction
In this project, we used the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to build a decision tree classifier. The goal was to predict whether a customer would purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

Data Preprocessing
The dataset was first checked for missing values, and categorical variables were converted to dummy variables. The data was then split into training and testing sets to allow for model evaluation.

Model Training
A decision tree classifier was created and trained on the training data. The classifier's performance was evaluated using the testing data, and key metrics such as the confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score were calculated.

Model Evaluation
The decision tree classifier achieved an accuracy score of around 89%. The confusion matrix and classification report provided further insights into the model's performance, including precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes (purchased and not purchased).

Visualization
The decision tree was visualized to understand the decision rules and feature importance. The plot showed how the classifier makes decisions at each node, providing a clear view of the decision-making process.

Conclusion
The decision tree classifier provided a robust model for predicting customer purchases based on the given data. The visualization of the decision tree helped in understanding the decision-making process and feature importance. This model can be further refined and used for targeted marketing strategies to improve customer conversion rates.
